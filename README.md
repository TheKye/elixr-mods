# Notes

Please do not code rip or redistribue code found in the EM Framework

Nuget Packages are manually added by me but can be found here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/ElixrMods.Framework/

We also understand its easy to recreate systems in your own ways, there are some parts of code in the framework that have been absorbed from other mods with permission from those creators
