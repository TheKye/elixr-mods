The Ability To Override Other Compiled Mod Recipes that use the EM Recipe Resolver

​CustomStackLimit Restriction, Lets you change the max stack size of all items in this storage except for tools, will also not let you store garbage (garbage, tailings, wet tailings) using this restriction
​StackAllLimitRestriction, Allows you to multiply the stack size amount, IE: 1.5x or 2x for all items stored in this storage

- Namespaces have not changed just the Assembly Name, this will break backwards compatibility
- Using The IRecipeOverride will not crash the server if the mod it is using to override doesn't exist or the mod it is overriding doesn't exist it will just put an error in the console then finish the server boot
