-----

IChatCommandHandler Interface Was Removed -
IChatCommandHandler has been replaced by: [ChatCommandHandler] Attribute, it acts the same as the interface inheritence, no optional parameters for this

------

IServerPlugin now contains a public string GetCategory() => ""; Method, This is used to categorize the Plugin in the Server UI

------

WorldObject.Position No longer contains definitions for Vector3i: XZi, XYi, XYZi etc

Use Vector3Extensions instead:
Example: 
Vector3Extensions.XZi(Vector3 position) - This will give you a vector2 to use 

Alternatively if you can get away with just the Vector3, then just use: WorldObject.Position

------

Player.Position.XZi is now a method instead of a Variable

------

SolidGroundComponent Removed

Use SolidAttachedSurfaceRequirementComponent instead
This new component now Supports Directional Specification: 
This means you can specify where it should attach to (Wall, Roof, Floor)

------

DurabilityItems no longer have Durability Manipulation, (This is more for those mods kinda like the whetstone mod)

All tools have been changed to a "RepairableItem" which has durability manipulation

DurabilityItem is now a base class for building different types of durability items from it (Such as the new food spoilage system)

*IDynamicValue SkillRepairCost Override is now under RepairableItem as well instead of durability item

DurabilityItem Now has a GetDurability Method for durability calculations.

------

Base Method: OnCreate() has been removed.

Use New Base Method: OnCreatePostInitialize() or OnCreatePreInitialize instead
