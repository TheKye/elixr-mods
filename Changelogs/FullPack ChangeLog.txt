if BlockName = mortared stone - it will try and match against: MortaredStoneFloorBlock - If this matches it will return that value
if BlockName = mortared stone wall - it will try an find a match to: MortaredStoneWall* - It will check if MortaredStoneWallFloorBlock matches ( which it won't ) and if it doesnt it will move to the next one: 
MortaredStoneWall (which is not a block type so it will fail here as well) and if that fails it will move to the last one: MortaredStoneWallBlock (which does have a match) and return that block type based off your string input.

You can also set the chance of each pack, so say you want a higher chance to get the lower pack,
This also works with groups as we added a start tier, Tiers are used to determine the value of a pack, higher tiers mean the pack is a higher value ( this is self set )
you can set it so different groups start at a higher tier, ie Tier 2 for the VIP group, the randomizer will then only select from packs that have a tier value of 2 or higher instead of the default 0
Daily resets should now work properly and give you an indication of how long you have to wait to be able to get the next daily pack
Token XP can be set easily through a command "/daily-config xp, xp amount in whole numbers ( ie 10 )
Tokens are only gainable through being admin given or added into a pack,

Use "/home" for the home commands,
Use "/autodoors" for the autodoor commands
Use "/afk" for the AFK Commands
Use "/warp" for the Warp Commands

Warp Command changed to "/warpto" as "/warp" now lists all warp commands


Now introducing Groups Permissions System:

While our Permissions system is still under development this is some basic documentation on what we have so far and will be updated as we add more features to it:
Using the EM Permissions system is easy, 

What the EM permissions system brings to you is the ability to be able to create new user groups and give them access to commands so long as they are in that group, 

Example,

Joe donated to your server, You can create the group called "VIP" and add joe to that group, 

You can then assign commands to that group for joe to use:
Say you have teleport commands on the server, you can add the teleport command to the group VIP then Joe can use the teleport command,

Usage for server admins:

By default there are 2 user groups, Admin and Default, These 2 groups can not be deleted
If the user is already an admin they don't need to be added to the admin group, but if the user isn't an admin you can ad them to the admin group and assign your admins certain commands, IE: kick, mod based commands or what ever you feel like


Here is a list of all the commands that a admin/ owner  in the server can use:
Commands for giving groups permissions to commands

"/CommandPermissions grant command, groupname " // Used to give groups permission to use a command: Eg:
"/CommandPermissions grant fly, VIP" //this gives the group VIP access to use the /fly command
You cannot assign shortcuts to a command, ie: ElixrMods Auto door has a shotcut command: /ad-on
doing: "/CommandPermissions grant ad-on, VIP" will not work

"/CommandPermissions revoke command, groupname" // Used to revoke a groups permission to a command: Eg:
"/CommandPermissions revoke fly, VIP" // Will take away the ability for the VIP group to use the /fly command
You cannot use shortcodes when revoking a command ie: 
doing: "/CommandPermissions revoke ad-on, VIP" will not work

"/CommandPermissions setbehaviour admin/user, true/false" //this is used to allow Admins or users default access to their default commands:
ie:
"/CommandPermissions setbehaviour admin, false" // will mean any user that was made an admin will not have access to admin commands anymore and you will need to assign then use of admin commands via a group ie: Group Admin.
"/CommandPermissions setbehaviour user, false" // will mean any user that is not in a group or an admin will not be able to use any command without being in a group


Shortcuts:
"/grant-command command, groupname"
"/revoke-command command, groupname"
"/behaviour-command admin/user, true/false"


The "command" In the commands is any command in the eco game, regardless if its registered by a mod or a core command!
Creating Groups and adding users to groups commands

"/groups addgroup groupname" // Used to create a new group
"/groups deletegroup groupname" // used to delete a created group
"/groups listgroups" // will list all groups you have on the server
"/groups grouppermissions groupname" // Will list all the permissions the named group has 
"/groups addusertogroup username, groupname" // will add a user to a selected group or will creat the group then add the user too it
"/groups removeuserfromgroup username, groupname" // will remove a user from that group, if the group doesn't exist it will tell you
"/groups forcesave" //forces the groups system to save everything just incase a save fails

All commands that use a username are case sensitive so make sure your naming is correct otherwise it will say that user doesn't exist

Shortcuts:
"/grp-add groupname"
"/grp-del groupname"
"/grp-list"
"/grp-perms groupname"
"/grp-adduser username"
"/grp-remuser username"
"/grp-fs"


Config File Structure - If you are not comfortable editing this file then please just use the in game commands - Located in Configs/Mods
ElixrMods-GroupsDate.json
{
  "Groups": [
    {
      "GroupName": "groupname", // The Name of each group
      "GroupUsers":  [
        {
          "Name": "Username", // The username of the person added to the group
          "SlgID": "slgid", // their slgid if present
          "SteamID": "steamid" // their steamid if present

For Modders:
There isn't much you need to do to be able to use our permissions system,
To enforce the use of the permissions system you can do the following:

When creating a Chat Command set the following:

[ChatCommand("Description", "Shortcut", ChatAuthorizationLevel.Admin)]
[ChatSubCommand("Command Parent", "Description", "shortcut", ChatAuthorizationLevel.Admin)]


By setting the commands to be used by admins means server owners can assign these commands to any group and allow users in that group to use these commands regardless of them being admin level commands, this also means a user needs to be in a group to use these commands

If you set them like this: 

[ChatCommand("Description", "Shortcut", ChatAuthorizationLevel.User or Leave Blank)]
[ChatSubCommand("Command Parent", "Description", "shortcut", ChatAuthorizationLevel.User or Leave Blank)]


Any user will then be able to use the command unless the server owner turns off users being able to use user commands, However this may cause issues with users using /? command for help with a list of basic commands they would normally be able to use, 

Extensibilty:
Modders can also extend on the permissions system with their own commands for other features, This requires you to refrence our em-framework.dll and you can do some of the following with it:


namespace Eco.EM.Groups

[ChatSubCommand("CommandPermissions" //This sets your command to be a sub command of our permissions system and allows you to use: /permissions yourcommand,
"Your Command Description", 
"Your Command shortcut IE: Instead of using /CommandPermissions yourcommand you can use /yourcommand", 
ChatAuthorizationLevel.Admin // this enforces it to be usable by the permissions system and prevents un-authorized users from using the command, admins by default get access to this)]

Extra info

This is the using hook.
using Eco.EM.Groups;

GroupsManager.API.GetGroup(string group, bool true/false); //This will get a group, if it doesn't exist specify if it will create the group or not
GroupsManager.API.AllGroups() //This will get all of the available groups
GroupsManager.API.UserPermitted(User user, permssion) //This will get all the groups the user is in and check if any of those groups have permission to use the commands

Ease Of Use:
public static void yourfunction(string groupName)
{
Group group = GroupsManager.API.GetGroup(groupName); // assign group to a var to make your life easier when looking for groups
} 
GroupsManager.API.SaveData(); // Used to save your group based configuration to the groups file useful if you want a group to be able to have specific settings



Teleportation:

Now using the groups system:
use of the request (/tpr) command must be assigned to a group to be used, 
/teleportation configuretp (/tp-config) uses 4 settings when setting the config: Max, cost, expiry, cooldown 
Usage: /tp-config setting, value // all values are ints, 
Max - Total amount of teleports per day, 
Cost - Cost of calories per tp 0 to disable
expiry - How long a teleport request stays active in seconds
cooldown - how long they have to wait to use the tpr command again, in seconds
/tpa or /teleportation accept can be used by anyone without needing to be in a group
/teleportation groupconfiguretp groupname, setting, value
or "/tp-grpconfig groupname, setting, value"
Uses the same settings as the default settings for reference but sets a config per group, 
Group max teleports can not be less then the server default unless set to 0 which is unlimited teleports for the day
ie: /tp-grpconfig vip, max, 30 

To assign the tpr command to a group:

/grant-command request, groupname


Warps:

Now using the Groups System
use of the "/warp warpto" (/warpto) command must be assigned to a group to be used, 
/warp configurewarp (/warp-config) uses  settings when setting the config: Max, cost, cooldown
Usage: /warp-config setting, value // all values are ints, 
Max - Total amount of times they can go home per day, 
Cost - Cost of calories per returning home 0 to disable
Cooldown - Time they need to wait before being able to warp again
/warp-list or "/warp warplist" can be used by anyone without needing to be in a group
/warp groupconfigurewarp groupname, setting, value
or "/warp-grpconfig groupname, setting, value"
Uses the same settings as the default settings for reference but sets a config per group, 
Group max warp tps can not be less then the server default unless set to 0 which is unlimited teleports for the day
ie: /home-grpconfig vip, max, 30 

To assign the WarpTo command to a group:

/grant-command warpto, groupname

Homes:

Now using the Groups System
use of the GoHome (/gohome) command must be assigned to a group to be used, 
use of the AddHome (/home-add) command must be assigned to a group to be used,
/home configurehomes (/home-config) uses 4 settings when setting the config: Max, cost, count
Usage: /home-config setting, value // all values are ints, 
Max - Total amount of times they can go home per day, 
Cost - Cost of calories per returning home 0 to disable
Count - Total amount of homes they can set
/home-myinfo or "/home homeinfo" can be used by anyone without needing to be in a group
/home-del or "/home removehome" can be used by anyone without needing to be in a group
/home groupconfigurehomes groupname, setting, value
or "/home-grpconfig groupname, setting, value"
Uses the same settings as the default settings for reference but sets a config per group, 
Group max home tps can not be less then the server default unless set to 0 which is unlimited teleports for the day
ie: /home-grpconfig vip, max, 30 

To assign the gohome and the home-add command to a group:

/grant-command gohome, groupname
/grant-command addhome, groupname
