		The Tool allows you to paint certain blocks different Colors!
		
		Blocks that Support this system:
		- Concrete
		- Bricks
		- Glass
		
		All 3 of these have a colored version as per the EM Building Bundle, by using the Paint Brush and Paint Buckets you can paint these blocks different colors!
		
		To select the color of the paintbrush:
		
		Simply Right Click the paint brush in your toolbar and it will open a UI allowing you to select the color brush you use to paint the blocks
		
		Each colored brush requires its corresponding paint bucket to be able to paint blocks.

	<section>
		The Paint Buckets have many different colors, but also have durability. 
		
		Each Paint Bucket has enough paint in it to paint 100 blocks before it becomes an Empty Paint Bucket, which is then reused to make more paint buckets!
		
		There is a small bug where the paint brush can be tempermental about the paint bucket.
		
		It needs to be in your toolbar to be used, sometimes it may need to be infront or behind the paintbrush to work. not sure why! Sorry!
