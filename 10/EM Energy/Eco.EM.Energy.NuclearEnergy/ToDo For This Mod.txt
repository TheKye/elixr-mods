The EM Nuclear Energy Mod is a Multi Block Mod:

Requires Blocks like:

Reactor Block, 
Reactor Glass, 
Cooling Rods
Nuclear Rods
Input Valve - For Water for cooling
Output Valve - For Hot water/steam/waste

Requires a single world object:
Reactor Controller:

The reactor controller would have a full detailed display of the reactors function:
Power output, 
Water Input,
Cooling Rate,
Current Temp,

The Reactor controller would detect the outer blocks via a connection system to allow for multi size building, (Detects blocks and connected blocks)

If valid allow operation

On Off component allows the control of the reactor

Special Second World object would be an Emergency Shutoff Controller - 
If Temp > Max Safe Temp, Shut reactor down

The reactor should be able to operate with any flow rate, no minimum required, but flow rate affects temp: Lower flow rate = higher temp

When the reactor hits too high of a temp it should Explode, dealing block damage (Destroying blocks) in x radius, and adding a whole bunch of pollution

Require Reactor Maintenance - 
Damaged Cooling Rods, Over time replace Cooling rod with slightly damaged cooling rod, then dammaged then highly damaged then gone (Should delete itself after x time)

Add a maintenance hatch to be able to enter the reactor (If open, reactor should be shut down) and replace broken parts


If Adding Steam, Should add a way to convert steam to power (Another Reactor mod already does this so it will need to be done with consideration)
