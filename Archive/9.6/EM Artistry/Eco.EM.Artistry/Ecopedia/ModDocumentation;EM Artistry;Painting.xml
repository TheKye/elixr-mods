First you will need a Paint Brush.

Next you will need a Paint Bucket.

With the Paint Bucket and the Paint Brush in your inventory you are ready to start painting.

To set the color you wish to paint with you just need to right click on the Paint Brush, it will then bring up a menu for you to select the color you want to use.

Select the color and click "Submit"

This will then give you the Color Paintbrush you want.

Next make sure you have the Corresponding color Paint Bucket for the Paint Brush you want.

Then just walk up to the block you wish to paint and the system should take care of the rest.

To avoid Waste, Each Paint Bucket can be re-used. Once it runs out of paint it will turn into an empty bucket.

Each Paint bucket has enough paint to be able to paint 100 Blocks.
